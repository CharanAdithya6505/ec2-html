# EC2 HTML

This repository contains an animated, visually stunning NGINX logo implemented purely in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

## Features

- **Geometric Server Rings**: Rotating 3D rings that simulate an advanced web server core.
- **Neon Pulse Text**: The iconic NGINX name glows with a rhythmic cyber-green pulse.
- **Data Packet Animation**: Simulates incoming web traffic pointing toward and visualizing interactions with the server core.
- **Boot Sequence Terminal**: A lower-thirds terminal printing out standard server initialization sequences (e.g., `LOADING NGINX.CONF...`, `BINDING TO 0.0.0.0:80...`).
- **Data Grid Background**: A dark techno-themed background layered with an animated data-grid floor rotating in pseudo-3D perspective.

## Files
